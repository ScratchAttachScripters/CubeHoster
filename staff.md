To staff, here are our current tasks. If possible, we will make a website dedicated to this.

Make a script that will run when a image is requested. The script should grab the image link from the project and send a cubeupload link to the user.
Work on the project together using Gandi IDE / BlocksLive
Release to public and hope it works.
